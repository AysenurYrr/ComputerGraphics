## Installation

To clone this repository, use the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AysenurYrr/ComputerGraphics.git
```

## Usage
In the 3DObjTransformation directory use the following command:
```bash
python main.py teapot.obj
```

*The Python code utilized leverages the "vertex" (v) and "face" (f) information from the .obj file. No shadowing or wb operations are performed.*

Taking into account the sentence above, you can use different files with the .obj extension.
